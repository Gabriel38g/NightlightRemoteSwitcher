# NightlightRemoteSwitcher
this project/code requires:
an ESP32 board. (Many boards will work. You might just have to try it)
an RGB led (four pins)
an OLED display 1306 model or similar.
connection wires hooked up to pins accurate to the code. (pin declarations are listed at or near the beginning of the code.)

When the program is running in Arduino IDE, the ESP32 will output the website location to the Serial mmonitor. It will probably look like 192.168.x.x

This program is demonstrated in my video on Youtube: https://youtu.be/iVM-wkGSy80
